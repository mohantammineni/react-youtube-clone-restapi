A youtube clone built using react js. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]. To make it work similar to youtube I have used REST API to enable search functionality and also display video of different ategories. 

To make this work for you as it looks in the demo, you have to create an account on Rapid api and add your api key in the configuration file in place of 'YOUR_REST_API_KEY_HERE'.  

To install the dependencies run ### `npm install`.

To view the application,
### `npm start`

to run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
